Download `Authenticator 2FA` App from App Store..

In the mobile app, suppose you have the authenticator app like `TOTP Authenticator`. Click the entry `...` and `Edit` button or something like that, and then a `eye` button. You'll get a QR code.

In the app, click `+` and scan the QR code. Now you get the authentication code on mac.
