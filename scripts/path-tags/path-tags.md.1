1. def: Get all md recursively in the input folder
2. def: input markdown content, extract Front Matter (as yaml or string? as you like. Keep the order). If it has no fron matter, return None
3. def: get relative path of a md file from git repo root
    - example: in repo `how-to`, if the file is `scripts/path-topic/path-topic.md`, it returns `scripts/path-topic/path-topic.md`
4. for every front matter, get the value of tags.
    - Also split basename of the path. For the above example, you get `scripts` and `path-topic`
    - If any split is not in `tags`, add it to tags and rewrite the markdown file.
