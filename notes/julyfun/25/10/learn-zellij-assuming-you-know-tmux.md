When do you need zellij
- If you like ghostty on 10/20 2025 and you like ssh and tmux, you will find tmux not working on remote tmux in ghostty.
    - although this may solve the problem: https://ghostty.org/docs/help/terminfo#ssh

## key
- `ctrl-b + %` => `ctrl-p + r`
- `ctrl-b + "` => `ctrl-p + d`
- Switch between =>`ctrl`
- Close pane => `ctrl-p + x`

## cool useful key
- Stack panes `ctrl-p + s`
