To design an API for efficiently uploading large dataset files from mobile devices to a PC server, the following features are essential based on industry best practices and technical requirements:

---

## **Core Features**
### **1. Resumable Uploads**
- Allow uploads to pause and resume automatically after network interruptions, avoiding restarts. Critical for mobile environments with unstable connections[1][4].
- Implement session tracking (e.g., unique upload IDs) to manage interrupted transfers[1][7].

### **2. Chunked File Transfer**
- Split large files into smaller chunks (e.g., 100 MB each) to:
  - Reduce memory strain on servers and clients[1][2].
  - Enable retries of failed chunks without resending the entire file[5].
- Use multipart/form-data encoding for efficient chunk assembly[2][5].

### **3. Streaming Support**
- Process files as they are uploaded (client-to-server streaming) to avoid buffering entire datasets in memory[1][2].
- Example: Use Node.js `createReadStream` or .NET `Request.Body` streaming[1][2].

### **4. Cloud Storage Integration**
- Directly upload files to cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob) via pre-signed URLs to offload server processing[5][8].
- Reduce API latency by separating file uploads from metadata handling[3][8].

### **5. CDN and Geographic Optimization**
- Route uploads to the nearest CDN edge location (e.g., AWS Transfer Acceleration) to minimize latency[1][4].
- Ensure global users experience consistent speeds[1][4].

---

## **Performance and Reliability**
### **6. Error Handling and Logging**
- Implement robust error logging to diagnose failures (e.g., network timeouts, corrupted chunks)[2][5].
- Validate checksums (e.g., MD5, SHA-256) for data integrity[1][5].

### **7. Rate Limiting and Throttling**
- Prevent server overload by limiting concurrent uploads or bandwidth per client[2][5].
- Use asynchronous processing for heavy workloads (e.g., Hangfire)[2].

### **8. Timeout Management**
- Adjust server and client timeouts to accommodate large transfers[2][5].
- Use keep-alive signals to maintain active sessions[7].

---

## **Security**
### **9. Secure Transfers**
- Enforce HTTPS for encrypted data transmission[1][4].
- Use token-based authentication (e.g., OAuth 2.0) to control access[4][8].

### **10. Access Controls**
- Restrict upload permissions via roles (e.g., admin, user)[1][4].
- Validate file types and sizes to prevent malicious uploads[8].

---

## **User Experience**
### **11. Progress Tracking**
- Provide real-time upload progress (e.g., percentage completed) to users[4][5].
- Send email/SMS notifications on success or failure[4].

### **12. Client-Side SDKs**
- Offer mobile SDKs (iOS/Android) to simplify integration:
  - Automatic chunking and retries[1][4].
  - Network optimization (e.g., Wi-Fi vs. cellular)[5].

### **13. Compression**
- Enable optional on-device compression (e.g., ZIP) to reduce transfer sizes[5].

---

## **Scalability**
### **14. Load Balancing**
- Distribute upload requests across multiple servers to handle high traffic[1][8].
- Use auto-scaling to adjust capacity dynamically[4].

### **15. Metadata Support**
- Attach custom metadata (e.g., timestamps, device info) to files during upload[8].

---

By combining these features, the API will ensure fast, reliable, and secure large file transfers from mobile devices, even in low-bandwidth environments. Solutions like **Uploadcare**[1] or **TransferNow**[4] provide prebuilt infrastructure, while custom implementations can leverage AWS S3, resumable protocols[7], and client SDKs for optimal performance.
