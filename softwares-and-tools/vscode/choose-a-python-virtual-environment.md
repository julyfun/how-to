Only need to use the default "Python" extension.

Command:

Select Interpreter

After choosing an interpreter, you may not see the changes on screen immediately. You can't even see any notice. Just wait for a minute and see if things are going right.

Well sometimes like 23.9.28 the intellisense does not work for importing d2l in 5 mins after choosing interpreter. Well I just reload the workspace and the intellisense works. Damn. And on some type the intellisense didn't work. And I rewrite the type and it works again! Damn damn.
