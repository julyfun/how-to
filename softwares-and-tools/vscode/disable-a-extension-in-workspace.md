If you don't want to permanently remove an extension, you can instead temporarily disable the extension by clicking the gear button at the right of an extension entry. You can disable an extension globally or just for your current Workspace. You will be prompted to reload VS Code after you disable an extension.

在插件栏目选择插件后，可以点击“禁用”右边的箭头选择“禁用（工作区）”。
