## MLE
知道一组采样 $x_i$，求一组参数 $theta$，使得 $Pi "PDF"(x_i) $ 最大.

- consistency (lim -> 0)
- Asymptotic Normality 渐近正态性 $->^d N(0, 1 \/ I(theta_0))$

## Fisher Information
$I(theta) = - EE [(partial^2 ell)/(partial theta^2)] ="for 伯努利"= 1/(theta(1 - theta))$

We have introduced three key properties for evaluating estimators:
1. Unbiasedness: The estimator’s expected value equals the true parameter.
2. Efficiency: Among unbiased estimators, the one with the smallest variance is
preferred. The Cram´ er-Rao lower bound provides a benchmark.

3. Consistency: As the sample size increases, the estimator converges to the true
parameter.

For Maximum Likelihood Estimators, we have two important asymptotic proper-
ties:
1. Consistency: The MLE converges to the true parameter as the sample size
grows.
2. Asymptotic Normality: The distribution of the MLE, appropriately scaled,
approaches a normal distribution. This allows for inference in large samples.
These properties provide a foundation for choosing and justifying estimators in
statistical practice.
