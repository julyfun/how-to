2.6 BPE Tokenizer: Encoding and Decoding
In the previous part of the assignment, we implemented a function to train a BPE tokenizer on input text
to obtain a tokenizer vocabulary and a list of BPE merges. Now, we will implement a BPE tokenizer that
loads a provided vocabulary and list of merges and uses them to encode and decode text to/from token IDs.
2.6.1 Encoding text
The process of encoding text by BPE mirrors how we train the BPE vocabulary. There are a few major
steps.
Step 1: Pre-tokenize. We first pre-tokenize the sequence and represent each pre-token as a sequence of
UTF-8 bytes, just as we did in BPE training. We will be merging these bytes within each pre-token into
vocabulary elements, handling each pre-token independently (no merges across pre-token boundaries).
Step 2: Apply the merges. We then take the sequence of vocabulary element merges created during BPE
training, and apply it to our pre-tokens in the same order of creation.

Example (bpe_encoding): BPE encoding example
For example, suppose our input string is 'the cat ate', our vocabulary is {0: b' ', 1: b'a', 2:
b'c', 3: b'e', 4: b'h', 5: b't', 6: b'th', 7: b' c', 8: b' a', 9: b'the', 10: b'
at'}, and our learned merges are [(b't', b'h'), (b' ', b'c'), (b' ', 'a'), (b'th', b'e'),
(b' a', b't')]. First, our pre-tokenizer would split this string into ['the', ' cat', ' ate'].
Then, we’ll look at each pre-token and apply the BPE merges.
The first pre-token 'the' is initially represented as [b't', b'h', b'e']. Looking at our list of
merges, we identify the first applicable merge to be (b't', b'h'), and use that to transform the
pre-token into [b'th', b'e']. Then, we go back to the list of merges and identify the next applicable
merge to be (b'th', b'e'), which transforms the pre-token into [b'the']. Finally, looking back at
the list of merges, we see that there are no more that apply to the string (since the entire pre-token
has been merged into a single token), so we are done applying the BPE merges. The corresponding
integer sequence is [9].
Repeating this process for the remaining pre-tokens, we see that the pre-token ' cat' is represented
as [b' c', b'a', b't'] after applying the BPE merges, which becomes the integer sequence [7, 1,
5]. The final pre-token ' ate' is [b' at', b'e'] after applying the BPE merges, which becomes the
integer sequence [10, 3]. Thus, the final result of encoding our input string is [9, 7, 1, 5, 10,
3].
Special tokens. Your tokenizer should be able to properly handle user-defined special tokens when encod-
ing text (provided when constructing the tokenizer).
Memory considerations. Suppose we want to tokenize a large text file that we cannot fit in memory.
To eﬀiciently tokenize this large file (or any other stream of data), we need to break it up into manageable
chunks and process each chunk in-turn, so that the memory complexity is constant as opposed to linear in
the size of the text. In doing so, we need to make sure that a token doesn’t cross chunk boundaries, else
we’ll get a different tokenization than the naïve method of tokenizing the entire sequence in-memory.
2.6.2 Decoding text
To decode a sequence of integer token IDs back to raw text, we can simply look up each ID’s corresponding
entries in the vocabulary (a byte sequence), concatenate them together, and then decode the bytes to a
Unicode string. Note that input IDs are not guaranteed to map to valid Unicode strings (since a user
could input any sequence of integer IDs). In the case that the input token IDs do not produce a valid
Unicode string, you should replace the malformed bytes with the oﬀicial Unicode replacement character
U+FFFD.
3 The errors argument of bytes.decode controls how Unicode decoding errors are handled, and
using errors='replace' will automatically replace malformed data with the replacement marker.
Problem (tokenizer): Implementing the tokenizer (15 points)
Deliverable: Implement a Tokenizer class that, given a vocabulary and a list of merges, encodes
text into integer IDs and decodes integer IDs into text. Your tokenizer should also support user-provided
special tokens (appending them to the vocabulary if they aren’t already there). We recommend the
following interface:
def __init__(self, vocab, merges, special_tokens=None) Construct a tokenizer from a given
vocabulary, list of merges, and (optionally) a list of special tokens. This function should accept
3See en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specials_(Unicode_block)#Replacement_character for more information about the Unicode
replacement character.

the following parameters:
vocab: dict[int, bytes]
merges: list[tuple[bytes, bytes]]
special_tokens: list[str] | None = None
def from_files(cls, vocab_filepath, merges_filepath, special_tokens=None) Class
method that constructs and return a Tokenizer from a serialized vocabulary and list of merges
(in the same format that your BPE training code output) and (optionally) a list of special
tokens. This method should accept the following additional parameters:
vocab_filepath: str
merges_filepath: str
special_tokens: list[str] | None = None
def encode(self, text: str) -> list[int] Encode an input text into a sequence of token IDs.
def encode_iterable(self, iterable: Iterable[str]) -> Iterator[int] Given an iterable of
strings (e.g., a Python file handle), return a generator that lazily yields token IDs. This is
required for memory-eﬀicient tokenization of large files that we cannot directly load into
memory.
def decode(self, ids: list[int]) -> str Decode a sequence of token IDs into text.
To test your Tokenizer against our provided tests, you will first need to implement the test adapter
at [adapters.get_tokenizer]. Then, run uv run pytest tests/test_tokenizer.py. Your imple-
mentation should be able to pass all tests.
按照上述要求完成

1. dec.rs 实现 encoding 算法. 模仿 core.rs 的链表、状态管理和基于堆的 merge，时间复杂度要和 core.rs 一样低。
2. 使用同样的 PAT 和 join
3. 核心算法不用 pyo3 包装，写单元测试（直接 #[test] 不用开 tests module) 接口用 pyo3 封装并仅在 features 下启用. 接口详见上述 def 要求
4. 实现 decoding. 让 python 端 满足 from_files 等等接口
5. 实现 adapter. 通过 uv 测试
6. 从 python 端读取 (json.load) 项目根目录/data/ 下的 json，解码传递给 rust.

如有不确定信息，先问我让我批准
